# Day 1 - Environment Setup and Technical Foundation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Morning Session (4 hours)
- [x] Conda environment setup with CUDA support
- [x] PEFT libraries installation (transformers, peft, accelerate, bitsandbytes)
- [x] Project structure creation and Git initialization  
- [x] Wandb configuration and GPU validation

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)
- [x] PEFT repository exploration (HuggingFace PEFT, X-LoRA)
- [x] GPU capacity testing with materials science models
- [x] Base configuration system implementation
- [x] Experiment tracking framework setup

## 📊 Key Findings

### GPU Capacity Analysis
- A40 GPU: 48GB memory available
- MatSciBERT + LoRA: ~8GB memory usage
- ChemBERTa-77M + LoRA: ~6GB memory usage
- Capacity for multiple concurrent experiments: ✅

### Technical Validation
- CUDA functionality: ✅
- PEFT integration: ✅
- Wandb tracking: ✅ (team visibility acceptable)
- Reproducibility framework: ✅

## 🎯 Day 2 Preparation

### Priority Tasks
1. Dataset acquisition and analysis (MoleculeNet, MatBench)
2. Baseline model performance benchmarking
3. Data preprocessing pipeline implementation
4. Initial PEFT experiments on small datasets

### Resource Allocation
- Estimated compute cost Day 2: ~€67
- Focus datasets: FreeSolv (642 compounds), ESOL (1128 compounds)
- Target: Complete data pipeline + first PEFT results

## ⚠️ Identified Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- Docker dependency → Resolved: Git + conda approach
- Wandb privacy → Resolved: Team visibility acceptable
- Memory constraints → Validated: Sufficient for planned experiments

### Timeline Risks  
- Setup delays → Mitigated: Day 1 completed on schedule
- Data access issues → Prepared: Multiple dataset sources identified

## 📋 Tomorrow's Success Criteria
- [ ] All target datasets downloaded and analyzed
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established
- [ ] First PEFT experiments completed on FreeSolv
- [ ] Statistical analysis framework operational
